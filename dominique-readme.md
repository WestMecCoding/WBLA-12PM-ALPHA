# Project Documentation - Dominique Romero

## Project Summary
Our project was for Borcelle Coffee Roastery. I worked on a small amount of CSS in this project and did most of the wireframe for the team. I worked to complete the design and worked with the team to make the changes we deemed necessary on the final website where it deviated from the wireframe.

## Code
This code was for styling the buttons that switch the body text. I added box shadow, colors, and background colors that aligned with the color scheme that we were given to complete the overall page and fit nicely with other elements on the page.

```css
button.buttons {
    background-color: #D35E17;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    color: white;
    font-family: "Genty Demo Regular";
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 2px #742c0080;
    border: 3.5px solid #742D00;
}

.buttons:hover {
background-color: #F4E9DD;
color:#F2AE1C;
cursor: pointer;
font-size: 1.6rem;
}
```
